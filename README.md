# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview

An analysis was made to study the numbers of retiring emlpoyees in the "silver tsunami" that is expected in the company, and analyze the numbers of potential retirees who could participate in a mentorship program that could potentially help retain knowledge lost from this change.

## Results
- Through the combinations of given spreadsheets by using joins to form different data results, we are able to find the number of employees who are at retirement age, as well as find out how many could potentially be part of the mentorship program.
- Based on the information, 24% of the company's employees are eligible for retirement.
- Most of the retirees are a Senior Engineeer or Senior Staff. Only two are a Managers.
- of the number of retiring employees (72,459), 1,550 are eligible for a mentorship program (described as the employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965).

## Summary
In all, 71,477 positions will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" makes an impact. Considering there are only 1,550 elgible employees that qualify for the mentorship program, there may not be enough to fully develop the remaining 227,566 employees.
